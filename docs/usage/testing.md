Testing
=======

TODO Should cover:
- Basics of testing
- Don't be preachy, just explain that we've included some helpers


Testing Templates
-----------------

TODO Should cover:
- Using the template helper
- Mention that usage isn't restricted to Mocha
- Don't use Proclaim in here, just use built-in assert
- Example tests (don't be specific about the directory, maybe just add this in `tests` for now and note that you can organise your tests in any way you like)
- Running tests with the `mocha` command


Testing Client-Side JavaScript
------------------------------

TODO Should cover:
- Using the test-client CLI (Reference `./node_modules/.bin/shunter-test-client`, not `test-client.js`)
- The libraries used in test-client ([Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Proclaim](https://github.com/rowanmanning/proclaim))
- Example tests (don't be specific about the directory, maybe just add this in `tests` for now and note that you can organise your tests in any way you like)
